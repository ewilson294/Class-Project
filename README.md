This repository contains a script to create a tidy data set from UCI's data.

Analysis script
 - run_analysis.R

Tidy data sets in /UCI HAR Dataset

- Means_and_Standard_Deviations.csv
- Subject_Averages.csv

Code Book
- CodeBook.md

run_analysis.R takes the "raw" data from the UCI data set and creates two tidy data sets

Means_Standard_Deviations.csv is a tidy data set of the means and standard deviations from the UCI Data

Subject_Averages.csv takes the data set from Means_and_Standard_Deviations and averages it by subject and by activity

See 'UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt' for original README for the data
